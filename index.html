About Me
Supporting children, teens, and the adults who love them.
I’m a clinical psychologist with over 25 years of experience helping families understand and manage emotions and behavior in children and teens. My goal is to make things like child development, managing big feelings and challenging behavior feel less overwhelming for children and their families.
I help families balance warmth with structure. I use simple analogies, visuals, and practical, step-by-step strategies that actually work with real kids.
Over the years, I’ve written books, created curricula, and trained thousands of professionals on stress, trauma, resilience, and social-emotional development in children and teens. Today, I’m in private practice in Michigan, where I continue the work I love: supporting children and families as they build coping skills, manage anxiety, and feel calmer, more confident, and more connected.
I’m also a mom of two teenage daughters, which keeps me very grounded in what this work looks like outside the therapy room.
